<p>An experienced user may wonder why you should even consider using this. Perhaps you know how to use Guitar Pro, Finale, or TuxGuitar. There would appear to be no use for this application...</p>
<p>Consider this, it may take your Windows, Linux, or Mac OS to use <em>your</em> desired program. Some are cross-platform. Some are not. Whether you are at band practice, on the road, at a show, or in your living room, you may not always have your desktop or laptop on-hand. Your band mate may not either. Your band mate may even use a different application. When that moment strikes, open up Scratch-tabs in your browser and write. Tell your band to do the same. When you're on the road, whip out your tablet, open up the application, and start writing.</p>
<p>Web-based tablature writers already exist. Why should this be any better? It may or may not be your solution. Continue on to the <a href="/home/ram/Desktop/tab-wiki/Comparison.md">Comparison</a> to learn why Scratch-tabs is different.</p>
